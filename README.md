# Explanatory Analysis of Manufacturing Downtime

## Project Background
A manufacturing facility producing six different beverage products has been experiencing significant production downtime, which has negatively impacted overall productivity levels.
The facility’s Operations Manager is responsible for recording key details during these downtime events, including timestamps, the responsible operator, and relevant contextual notes.

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of the various potential causes of downtime, using explanatory analytics to uncover actionable insights and provide a clear narrative that addresses the central question: “Why is this happening?”

**Key Areas to Note:**
- **Operator Level Analysis:** detailed evaluation of operator-related factors, individual efficiency levels, performance metrics, and the frequency of operator-induced downtime.

- **Pareto Principle Application (80/20 Rule):** Leveraging the Pareto method to identify and prioritize the most critical root causes contributing to prolonged downtime, enabling a focused approach to problem-solving.

- **Product Specific Downtime Assessment:** Analyzing production data to determine whether certain products are more prone to causing downtime, and uncovering the underlying reasons behind these product-related inefficiencies.

## Data Structure
### Data Cleaning 

Because the dataset came in different excel sheets, the first step was to pivot the fields using Index & Match in **Excel** to have relevant information all in one place.
The next step was to look at the provided dataset to ascertain key fields that would be important to this analysis and check for data types. 
The time fields were converted into a *'time'* Data type as ignoring this would give inaccurate or inconsistent results during visualization. Time too for the purpose of this report is calculated in minutes.
Finally, Power query in **Power BI** was used to perform quality checks.
Below is the structure of the dataset in the modeling view:
